Code and exercises from 
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

The book and course uses R but I'm using Python 3. 

## Website

Everything is displayed nicely and readably on [the project website](https://rmwenzel/islr)

## Datasets

Find these in `/datasets`

## Notes and Exercises

Notes and exercises are organized by chapter in a directory like `/<chapter name` which contains:

- `<chapter_name>_notes.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook of chapter notes for writing. All cells are Markdown, and there is no executable code. Contains a lot of LaTeX which is slow to render in Jupyter Notebook.
- `<chapter_name>_notes.slides.html` - Html of chapter notes for easy reading. LaTeX is rendered once-and-for-all, and well.
- `<chapter_name>_notes.pdf` - Pdf of chapter notes for easy reading. LaTeX is rendered once-and-for-all, although not perfectly.
- `<chapter_name>_notes.tex` - TeX file of chapter notes. If you know LaTeX and want to customize the notes, this is a good place to start (a few simple fixes will yeild a much nicer pdf).
- `/<chapter_name>_exercises` - directory for exercise files. Contains one or more of:
	- `/<chapter_name>_conceptual_exercises.ipynb` - single Jupyter Notebook for all conceptual exercises
	- `/<chapter_name>_<exercise name>.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook for `<exercise name>`
	- `/<chapter_name>_<exercise name>.py` - Python script for `<exercise name>`.

##### Remarks
Note that `<chapter_name>_notes.pdf` and `<chapter_name>_notes.latex` were generated by converting `<chapter_name>_notes.ipynb` with [IPython's notebook converter](`https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/notebook/nbconvert.html`). This tool uses `pandoc`and other output file formats are possible.

```
$ ipython nbconvert --to FORMAT notebook.ipynb
```

## Requirements and Dependencies.

Python dependencies were managed with a
[conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#). The requirements are stored in the config file `environment.yml`. 

If you have conda installed you can create the environment directly with

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
